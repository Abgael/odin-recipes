    <h1>Brigadeiro</h1>
    <img src="../images/traditional-brigadeiro-recipe-9.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Traditional brigadeiros in Brazil are chocolate fudge balls served in little cupcake flutes and topped with chocolate sprinkles. Like many Brazilian desserts, condensed milk is used as a base. Brigadeiros are considered a “must” at parties, since the bite-sized treats are so delicious and easy to make. They are also highly customizable, since they require only a few simple ingredients.</p>
    <p>Brigadeiros are quite similar to both truffles and American fudge. However, each of these confections has a slightly different texture due to their ingredients.</p>
    <p>Truffles are made with “ganache,” a mixture of chocolate and heavy cream. Their texture is soft and creamy, and they are often not as sweet as fudge or Brigadeiros.</p>
    <p>Like Brigadeiros, fudge is made with condensed milk and chocolate. However the ratio of chocolate to condensed milk is much higher, and the chocolate takes the form of chips or a chopped bar. The resulting texture is much harder than a truffle or a Brigadeiro.</p>
    <p>Brigadeiros typically incorporate butter and powdered chocolate in addition to the condensed milk, which makes them softer than fudge and slightly chewier than truffles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Dutch cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate sprinkles</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Paper candy cups</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a casserole dish or other non-stick baking dish</li>
        <li>Heat your condensed milk, butter, and cocoa powder in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until butter is melted and the mixture is slightly thickened (10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt and stir.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the greased baking dish.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Pour your sprinkles onto a large plate for easy coating.</li>
        <li>Using a small, 1.57” ice cream scoop or melon baller, scoop out the hardened mixture and roll each scoop into a smooth ball with your hands.</li>
        <li>Toss each ball into the dish with chocolate sprinkles until they are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Put each ball into a candy cup and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
